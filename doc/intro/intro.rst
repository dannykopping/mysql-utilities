What are the MySQL Utilities?
-----------------------------

It is a package of utilities that are used for maintenance and 
administration of MySQL servers. These utilities encapsulate a set of 
primitive commands, and bundles them so they can be used to perform 
macro operations with a single command. They can be installed via 
MySQL Workbench, or as a standalone package.

The utilities are written in Python, available under the GPLv2 license, 
and are extendable using the supplied library. 

How do we access the MySQL Utilities?
-------------------------------------

There are two ways to access the utilities from within the MySQL 
Workbench. Either use ``Plugins`` -> ``Start Shell for MySQL Utilities`` 
from the main Workbench toolbar, or click the MySQL Utilities icon from 
the main Workbench page. Both methods will open a terminal/shell 
window, and list the available commands.

You can launch any of the utilities listed by typing the name of the 
command. To find out what options are available, use the `--help` option, 
or read the appropriate manual page.
