MySQL Utilities Documentation
===============================

MySQL Utilities is both a set of command-line utilities as well as a
Python library for making the common tasks easy to accomplish. The
library is written entirely in Python, meaning that it is not
necessary to have any other tools or libraries installed to make it
work. It is currently designed to work with Python v2.6 or later and
there is no support (yet) for Python v3.1.
