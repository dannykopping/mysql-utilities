Usage: mysqlrpladmin.py --slaves=root@localhost:3306 <command>

mysqlrpladmin - administration utility for MySQL replication

  --help                
  --candidates=CANDIDATES
                        connection information for candidate slave servers for
                        failover in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>]. Valid only with
                        failover command. List multiple slaves in comma-
                        separated list.
  --discover-slaves-login=DISCOVER
                        at startup, query master for all registered slaves and
                        use the user name and password specified to connect.
                        Supply the user and password in the form
                        <user>[:<password>] or <login-path>. For example,
                        --discover-slaves-login=joe:secret will use 'joe' as
                        the user and 'secret' as the password for each
                        discovered slave.
  --exec-after=EXEC_AFTER
                        name of script to execute after failover or switchover
  --exec-before=EXEC_BEFORE
                        name of script to execute before failover or
                        switchover
  --log=LOG_FILE        specify a log file to use for logging messages
  --log-age=LOG_AGE     specify maximum age of log entries in days. Entries
                        older than this will be purged on startup. Default = 7
                        days.
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>]
  --max-position=MAX_POSITION
                        Used to detect slave delay. The maximum difference
                        between the master's log position and the slave's
                        reported read position of the master. A value greater
                        than this means the slave is too far behind the
                        master. Default is 0.
  --ping=PING           Number of ping attempts for detecting downed server.
  --seconds-behind=MAX_DELAY
                        Used to detect slave delay. The maximum number of
                        seconds behind the master permitted before slave is
                        considered behind the master. Default is 0.
  --slaves=SLAVES       connection information for slave servers in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>]. List multiple slaves
                        in comma-separated list.
  --timeout=TIMEOUT     Maximum timeout in seconds to wait for each
                        replication command to complete. For example, timeout
                        for slave waiting to catch up to master. Default =
                        300.
  --new-master=NEW_MASTER
                        connection information for the slave to be used to
                        replace the master for switchover, in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>]. Valid only with
                        switchover command.
  --force               ignore prerequsite check results and execute action
  -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                        display the output in either grid (default), tab, csv,
                        or vertical format
  --demote-master       make master a slave after switchover.
  --no-health           turn off health report after switchover or failover.
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug
  -q, --quiet           turn off all messages for quiet execution.
  --rpl-user=RPL_USER   the user and password for the replication user
                        requirement, in the form: <user>[:<password>] or
                        <login-path>. E.g. rpl:passwd - By default = none

Available Commands:

  elect       - perform best slave election and report best slave
  failover    - conduct failover from master to best slave
  gtid        - show status of global transaction id variables
                also displays uuids for all servers
  health      - display the replication health
  reset       - stop and reset all slaves
  start       - start all slaves
  stop        - stop all slaves
  switchover  - perform slave promotion

  Note: elect, failover, gtid, and health require --master and either
        --slaves or --discover-slave-login

  Note: start, stop and reset require --master and --slaves
